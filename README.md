# Confettify Button

This was a small project that I completed for CS 120 - Advanced Programing in my sophomor year at UVM. Some of the code for the project
was provided by the classes lecturer. The main contributions that I made to it were in the follwing sections:
- draw method in the Quad class.
- isOverlapping method in the Button class.
- Completing key elements in graphics.cpp.
- Implementing an enum to create the three screens.
- allowing user to interact with the button using mouse and keyboard inputs
